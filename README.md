## Udemy Clone Website

This project is a static clone of Udemy, designed to replicate the core layout and features of the popular online learning platform. Built using HTML and CSS, this website serves as a visual and structural mimicry of Udemy's interface, focusing on showcasing course listings and user profiles.

### Features

- **Homepage:** 
  - Hero section with a prominent call-to-action.
  - Overview of the platform with featured courses and popular categories.
  - Simplified navigation menu for easy access to different sections.

- **Course Listings Page:**
  - Displays a grid of courses with titles, brief descriptions, instructor names, and images.

- **Footer:**
  - Contains essential links such as contact information, terms of service, and privacy policy.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structured the content and layout of the website.
- **CSS:** Styled the website to provide a clean and modern appearance, focusing on typography, spacing, and color schemes.

### Limitations

- The website is non-responsive, meaning it does not adapt to different screen sizes or devices. As a result, it may not display optimally on mobile devices or tablets.

- The site is static, with no interactive elements or dynamic content.

### Future Enhancements

- **Responsive Design:** Implement media queries and flexible layouts to ensure the website is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Features:** Add JavaScript to introduce interactive elements like course filters, user authentication, and dynamic content updates.
- **Backend Integration:** Develop a backend system to manage user accounts, course data, and other dynamic content for a fully functional platform.
